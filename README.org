* Emacs Guides
  This repository saved a way to use my personal experiences and basic usage with GNU/Emacs.

  *Note*: More practice are not just look at sentences, it's can helps you learn quickly!

** Foundation in Foundation
   In Emacs, we have a rule:
   | Keybindings | Means                                                  |
   |-------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   | ~C-<char>~  | Press control key when entering the ~<char>~ character |
   | ~M-<char>~  | Press alt key when entering the ~<char>~ character     |
   | ~s-<char>~  | Press super key when entering the ~<char>~ character   |

   Example:
   #+begin_example
   C-f means press control and enter "f" character
   M-x means press alt and enter "x" character
   s-a means press super and enter "a" character (Seldom used)
   #+end_example

   And you sometimes encounter multiple consecutive key combinations, example: ~C-x C-c~ to exit the Emacs.

   If you want to exit some running command, use ~C-g~ to exit them.

   You can try press ~M-x~ key, It'll open a "toolbox", you can find all Emacs command in it.

   You can use ~C-f~ ~C-b~ ~C-n~ ~C-p~ keybindings to move cursor slowly:
   | Keybindings | Actions         |
   |-------------+-----------------|
   | ~C-f~       | Forward a char  |
   | ~C-b~       | Backward a char |
   | ~C-n~       | Next line       |
   | ~C-p~       | Previous line   |

---

   And you can use ~M-f~ ~M-b~ to move cursor by words:
   | Keybindings | Actions         |
   |-------------+-----------------|
   | ~M-f~       | Forward a word  |
   | ~M-b~       | Backward a word |

---

   *What? Not fast enough?* Try page up or page down by ~C-v~ ~M-v~:
   | Keybindings | Actions   |
   |-------------+-----------|
   | ~C-v~       | Page Down |
   | ~M-v~       | Page Up   |
   (Or you still can page up and page down by ~<PGUP>~ and ~<PGDN>~ keys)

---

   If you want the current line in a different location on the screen, you can use ~C-l~:
   | Keybindings         | Actions                                  |
   |---------------------+------------------------------------------|
   | ~C-l~ (first time)  | Re-center current line                   |
   | ~C-l~ (second time) | Put current line to top in the screen    |
   | ~C-l~ (third time)  | Put current line to bottom in the screen |

---

   ~C-a~ ~C-e~ ~M-a~ ~M-e~ can help you fast move cursor to beginning of line or end of line, sentences can do that too:
   | Keybindings | Actions               |
   |-------------+-----------------------|
   | ~C-a~       | Beginning of line     |
   | ~C-e~       | End of line           |
   | ~M-a~       | Beginning of sentence |
   | ~M-e~       | End of sentence       |

---

   And ~M-<~ ~M->~ is the fastest:
   | Keybindings | Actions           |
   |-------------+-------------------|
   | ~M-<~       | Beginning of file |
   | ~M->~       | End of file       |
